Hi!

We are Onion Galaxy, a gamedev team formed by 21 students of the Master's Degree in AAA Videogames Development of the UPC in Barcelona.

With this blog we have the idea of bring into a more personal terrain the evolution of this project. We want to bring to the table, from first hand,  all the process of what have supposed to us to develop a game and the engine behind it. So we are going to make a short brief of who we are.

We are a team composed from 14 programmers, 5 of them designers and 7 artists. This means that at the end we’ve become 21 multidisciplinar machine that they code, compose, debug and model at the same time.

The project was bringed to us from the beginning of the course. We were here to make a game, but it wasn’t until February that we started with the project itself. The game had to be a beat-em-up, multiplayer based in the frenetic Castle crashers. But we wanted to make a twist. So we bringed to the table lots and lots of proposals with different themes with the objective of trying to make something unique. The winner was Twinlight Souls, a magical adventure where you had to fight against the corruption and free the forest from the evil forces.

The first ideas were pretty different from what we have now. At first we had a more hopepunk version of the game, where you don’t really fight, and you had to use your kindness to break through. This idea didn’t match so well with the beat-em-up concept and soon we changed trying to make a more dynamic game. Even though,  we discarded a lot of ideas that  didn’t make the cut, and it was interesting to see how new ideas were build from them, so we grow from our mistakes.

With this blog, we hope to have this space to explain you this kind of process and decisions that we made through this whole project, so people can learn from them too.
